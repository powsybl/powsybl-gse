## Project Structure

The powsybl-gse project provides JavaFX components, a base JavaFX application and a build system to create standalone distributable GUI applications exposing functionality from the PowSyBl framework.

## Environment requirements

  * JDK *(1.8 or greater)* with JavaFX (e.g. the oracle JDK 1.8)
  * Maven *(3.3.9 or greater)*
  * powsybl-core : https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core

A simple way to build this project is to install the powsybl-core artifacts in your local maven repository. To do this, checkout the powsybl-core repository and run
```
$ mvn install
```

You can then run
```
mvn package -Pnative-package
```
to build a demo application. The resulting application is a distributable application image (a directory containing all necessary resources and a binary to run the application) available in se-demo/target/jfx/native/gse . You can run the application by launching the included binary (gse.exe on windows, gse on other systems). Because it's distributable, you can also move this folder to a more permanant place, the application will still run from the new location.

If you want to avoid putting artifacts in your maven repository, create an aggregator pom referencing powsybl-gse and powsybl-core as modules and run
```
$ mvn clean package -pl :powsybl-gse-demo -am -Pnative-package
```
